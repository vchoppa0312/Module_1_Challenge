It is a leading global payment technology provider that offers a comprehensive suite of payment solutions for businesses of all sizes. 

The company started by offering electronic payment processing and merchant services for point of sale and online businesses. It targeted the traditional payment services which are costly and time-consuming affair. With acquisitions and technological advancements, the company is now offering payments, online bank transfers and Banking as a Service solutions through fast, reliable and secure digital banking. It has targeted the issue of high settlement fees and multiple middle layers in payments & payouts processing. Combining cards issuing with acquiring and settlement accounts, all on one platform, the company has provided advantages of faster settlement time, savings on banking fees and unmatched authorization rates.

Apart from these major geographies, Nuvei also operates in Mexico, Latin America and Europe as well.

### What is unique about NUVEI

Nuvei’s payment solutions are proprietary and fully agnostic, meaniing, it was built from the ground up in-house and is constantly evolving based on client’s requirements. Rather than ‘service provider’, Nuvei operates as ‘strategic partner’ in true partnership with its clients, customizing and then productizing solutions to not only satisfy the clients' requirements – however unique they may be – but also contribute to the evolution of the global payment landscape.

While Nuvei has many competitors in the Fintech space especially based in USA, its home advantage lies in the business model of acquisitions and providing solutions for improved payment performance without the need to disrupt the client’s existing tech stack. The Nuvei offerings can been seen as performance boosters customizable while staying connected to preferred vendors. It provides unmatched authorization rates with its wide suite of APMs for eCommerce, a suite of over 600 APMs through a single integration enables its clients to efficiently reach their customers more completely.

### Which technologies does NUVEI use

Mobile payments, digital wallets, cloud-based technology, contactless payments through NFC and biometric authentication are some major technologies being used by Nuvei through their product suite.

The practical implementation of these technologies can be visualized as under.

- enabling secure real-time payments globally 
- real time transaction recovery engine to improve conversions for clients
- unique UI/UX payment page enabling pay-in and pay-out worldwide with localised capabilities
- sophisticated authentication systems developed to support PSD2 and SCA that reduce ‘soft declines’ for payments via 3D smart routing
- decreasing fraud with accelerated verification methods
- faster payment methods for instant pay-in and pay-out using open banking rails 
- the ability to pay for one transaction with multiple payment methods 

And technologies behind ML are also being roped in especially through **‘decline recovery’**, a revolutionary piece of smart tech that can not only identify the individual reason for a transaction’s decline, but that can automatically resolve the issue - whether it’s insufficient funds or technical malfunctions 

A pioneering algorithm has been integrated into a new risk engine for the extremely popular account-to-account payment method. Factors such as account age, transaction value, and balance usage will be analyzed by the engine to determine the risk level that a transaction is fraudulent and augment existing levels of security.

The machine learning model extracts complex patterns to improve the identification of fraudulent activity and reduce false positives where legitimate transactions are declined.

## Ecosystem: NUVEI's Landscape

Nuvei operates in the domain of Payments & Remittances and Digital Banking. It offers cutting-edge payment solutions, comprehensive payout choices, and robust financial services such as card issuing, banking, risk management and fraud prevention to enterprises of all sizes.

Fintech innovations in the payments industry have revolutionized the way we make payments, providing consumers with convenience, speed, and security. Mobile payments, peer-to-peer payments, digital wallets, cloud-based technology, contactless payments, and biometric authentication are just a few of the fintech innovations revolutionizing the payments industry in the last 5-10 years.

Nuvei's growth in terms of expanding market is achived through dual strategy of in-house technological advancements and acquisitions.

In August 2019, Nuvei completed its acquisition of SafeCharge for CA$1.1 billion and In November 2020, Nuvei completed the acquisition of Smart2Pay as part of a drive to strengthen its presence in high-growth digital commerce verticals. A month later in December 2020, Nuvei announced it was acquiring Base Commerce, a payment processing company specializing in bankcard and ACH payment processing. More recently in 2023, it acquired Paya Holdings, Nuvei's competetor in USA and BLIK in Poland.

Some of other major companies competing in this domain include Stripe, PayPal, FOMO Pay, Telr, and Safexpay. 

## KPIs: NUVEI's Performance

Nuvei's customer-centric and collaborative approach is having a vast impact on the FinTech's Paymnets domain. Nuvei serves over 200 markets worldwide including local acquiring in 45+ markets, supporting 150 currencies, and offering a suite of nearly 600 alternative payment methods.

Here is a look at Nuvei's recent performance in some of the key metrics.

**Revenue Growth** - Nuvei's 2023 third quarter results showed a revenue growth of 39% to $868.4 million from $623.0 million. According to Nuvei's latest financial reports the company's current revenue (TTM) is $0.98 B.

While its competetion in Paypal, Stripe and other major players in the domain have a larger market share globally, Nuvei is making big strides through acquisitions and native technological advancements.  

## NUVEI: The Next Move

My Idea for Nuvei is to venture more into ML/AI technologies.

To start with, the company could offer Robo Advising to its business clients on Forex management especially on Currency Options considering the company operates in different geographies and currencies.

With technological advancements in field of AI, the company, when the timing is appropriate, dwell into smart contracts to manage bill payments and trade settlements for its clients. All these as additional platforms without the need for client to alter there existing payment ecosystem.

Further, the company could acquire Supply Chain Management partner and using the history of data from its clients' payments, receivables and payables, we can optimize the payment schedules and inventory ordering thereby strengthening cashflows and making the payments work for clients' profits and revenue. All these automated through the technological advancements of ML/AI.   

I think offering these products would be a natural extension of the payment ecosystem. And, staying true to its operating model, Nuvei could extend these advanced solutions as plug and play SaaS platforms and be a one stop solution to Money Management for its business clients going beyond Payments Management.
While would provide more revenue generating options and savings to the clients, it would increase the transactions carried out through Nuvei's platforms and increase the company's revenue, client retention and overall profits.   

Apart from the existing technologies being used at Nuvei, these new products would need a heavier implementation of Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence technology, Big Data Analysis, Cloud-based Computing, Blockchain & Smart Contract technologies. 

To understand the client payment needs and suggest appropriate timing for trade settlements and bill payments, we must process huge amounts of historical data in real quick time and be reliable which can be achieved efficiently by ML/AI techniques. Similarly, real-time changes and movements of currencies and predictive capabilities for Robo-Advising on Forex Management also depends on latest developments in Data Analyis and ML which are more effective and efficient in providing the complete Money Management solutions to ever increasing NUVEI's clients and thier needs.
